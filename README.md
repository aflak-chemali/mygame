# Mastermind Game

Welcome to the Mastermind game! This classic code-breaking game challenges your deduction skills. Try to guess the secret code within the given attempts to emerge victorious.

## Game Introduction

Mastermind is a two-player game where one player sets a secret code, and the other player tries to guess the code. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating correct numbers and their positions.

## Game Rules
Mastermind is a game of deduction. Here are the rules:

1. Secret Code: The secret code is a 4-digit combination of numbers between 0 and 7.
2. Attempts: You have 10 attempts to guess the code.
3. Feedback: After each guess, you'll receive feedback on the correctness of your numbers and positions.
4. Feedback Format: Feedback is provided as 'X correct numbers and positions' or 'Y correct number(s) but in the wrong position, and Z correct number(s) and position(s)'.
5. Time Limit: The game has a time limit of 2 minutes. If you don't make a guess within 30 seconds, it defaults to '0 0 0 0'.

Good Luck: May the odds be in your favor!
